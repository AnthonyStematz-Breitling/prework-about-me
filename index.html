      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am 21. I used to feel 32 --hanging on by a thread above a bottomless pit.
         Now I feel like a 16 year old --the world is largely outside of my control,
         but it is also full of possibilities and new experiances. 
          <br>I can't wait to get started!
     </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up around Kansas City and I really like the creative energy that exists here.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy fencing, ballroom dancing, D&D, and basically anything emo.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I think being a rock star would be pretty rad.
        Being realistic though, I am looking for something that challenges me and keeps me learning new skills and I think coding can do that.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Waldo 
      --which is basically the closest thing you can get to a suburb 
      while still technically being inside the city.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I can thank my roommate Saphirah for being so insistent I try code!
        I didn't know how fullfilling code could be until I tried it out and I am really glad that I did!</p>
